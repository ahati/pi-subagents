/**
 * terminal-mouse.ts — wheel support for regular (non-alt-screen) TUI mode.
 *
 * pi only enables mouse reporting in `tuiMode: "fullscreen"` (the alt-screen
 * renderer parses SGR mouse input and dispatches it to overlay components). In
 * regular mode `TuiMainScreen` has no mouse code at all: the terminal keeps the
 * wheel for its own scrollback, and components never see an event.
 *
 * The terminal's write handle is public, so the panel can opt in for its own
 * lifetime: enable reporting while it is open, parse the wheel out of the input
 * stream (the focused overlay component receives it), and restore the terminal
 * when the panel closes. While captured, the terminal's native wheel scrollback
 * and mouse text-selection (Shift+drag in most terminals) belong to the panel.
 *
 * The sequences mirror pi-tui's alt-screen setup so the terminal state is the
 * one pi itself would have set.
